We think of kids being safe at day care but the danger is with MRSA, you canâ€™t see MRSA. Parents assume their kids are safe when in reality parents should be vigilant and demand preventative action. For over five years now I have written about the dangers of staph, MRSA and all the other nasty bugs. I have been very vocal about the failure of artificial turf owners, wrestling mat users, yoga mat users and yoga studios and other facilities that simply ignore the danger.
